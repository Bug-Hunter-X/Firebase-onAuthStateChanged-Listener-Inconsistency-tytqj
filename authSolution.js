To make the `onAuthStateChanged` listener more robust, implement the following improvements:

1. **Network Monitoring:** Add network connectivity checks before relying on authentication state changes. If the network is unavailable, display a clear message to the user and retry the authentication check later.
2. **Listener Management:** Ensure the listener is attached and detached appropriately. Avoid prematurely detaching it, especially if there's ongoing asynchronous authentication activity.
3. **State Persistence:**  Consider storing the user's authentication status locally (using browser storage or similar methods) to provide a temporary fallback if the network is unavailable or the listener is momentarily unavailable. 
4. **Exponential Backoff:** Implement an exponential backoff strategy for retrying network requests if an initial authentication check fails. This helps avoid overwhelming the server and gracefully handles temporary network interruptions.

```javascript
// authSolution.js
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';

const auth = getAuth();

const authStateChangedListener = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, see docs for a list of available properties
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.User
    const uid = user.uid;
    // ...
  } else {
    // User is signed out
    // ...
  }
});

// Clean up the listener when not needed (e.g., component unmount)
// ... later, for example when component unmounts
// authStateChangedListener();

// Example of network monitoring (requires a suitable network status library)
// ... check for network connectivity here before acting on user
```
